# Semantic Caching Chatbot Example

## Running this locally

1. Set up a new [semantic cache gateway](https://app.unkey.com/semantic-cache)
2. Update `.env` with your OpenAI API key and gateway name
3. `pnpm install`
4. `pnpm dev` to run this in development mode

This uses Unkey for semantic caching: [https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey]

This is a fork of the [Next.js AI Chatbot](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot), built with Next.js and Tailwind and deployed on Vercel.
